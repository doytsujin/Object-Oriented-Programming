<h1 style="text-align: center;">Social Network</h1>
Develop an application to support a social network. All classes must be
in the package "<b>social</b>".<br>

<hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">
<h2>R1 - Subscription</h2>
The interaction with the system is made using class <b>Social</b>.
<br>
You can register new account using method <b>addPerson()</b>
which receives as parameters a unique code, name and surname.<br>
The method throws the exception <b>PersonExistsException</b>
if the code passed is already associated to a subscription.<br>
The method <b>getPerson()</b> returns a string containing code, name
and surname of the person, in order, separated by blanks. If the code,
passed as a parameter, does not match any person, the method throws the
exception <b>NoSuchCodeException</b>.<br>
<br>

<h2>R2 - Friends</h2>
Any person, registered in the social, should have possibility to add
friends. Friendship is bidirectional: if person A is friend of a person
B, that means that person B is friend of a person A. Friendship is
created using method <b>addFriendship()</b> that receives as
parameters the codes of both. The method throws the exception <b>NoSuchCodeException</b> if one or both
codes do not exist.<br>
Method <b>listOfFriends()</b> receives as a parameter code of a person
and returns the collection of his/her friends. The exception <b>NoSuchCodeException</b> is thrown if the
code does not exist. If a person has no friends an empty collection is returned.<br>
The method <b>friendsOfFriends</b> receives as a parameter the code of a
person and returns the collection of the friends of his/her friends, i.e.
friends of the second level. The exception <b>NoSuchCodeException</b> is thrown if the
code do not exist.
If the list is empty the method returns an empty colletion. The list should not
contain the person whose code was passed as parameter in this method.
("remove yourself from the list") <br>
The method <b>friendsOfFriendsNoRepitition()</b> returns the list of codes
of friends of the second level (friends of the friends), like the
previous method, with
the difference that it should delete duplications. For example, Friend
A has Friend B and Friend D. Both B and D have Friend C. The method
friendsOfFriendsNoRepitition() called for A should return C only once.
If the list is empty the method should return and empty collection. The exception <b>NoSuchCodeException</b> is thrown if the
code do not exist.<br>

<h2>R3 - Groups</h2>
It is possible to register a new group using method <b>addGroup()</b>.
Name of the group should be a single word.<br>
The method <b>listOfGroups()</b> returns the list of names of all
registered groups. If there are no groups in the list the method should
return an empty collection.<br>
A person can subscribe to a group using method <b>addPersonToGroup()</b>
that receives as parameters the code of the person and the name of the
group. <br>
Method <b>listOfPeopleInGroup()</b> returns
collection of codes of people subscribed to a given group.<br>

<h2>R4 - Statistics</h2>
Method <b>personWithLargestNumberOfFriends()</b> returns code of a
person that has largest amount of friends (first level). Do not consider
the case of ties. <br>
Method <b>personWithMostFriendsOfFriends()</b> returns code of a person
that has largest amount of the friends of friends (second level). Do
not consider the case of ties. <br>
Method <b>largestGroup()</b> returns name of the group with largest
number of members. Do not consider the case of ties.<br>
Method <b>personInLargestNumberOfGroups()</b> returns code of a person
that is subscribed to largest number of groups. Do not consider the
case of ties.<br>

<h2>R5 - GUI Layout</h2>
<img src="img/GUI.png" style="float:right;width:35%;">
Develop the GUI for the social network application.
The class <b>SocialGui</b> that represent the interface provides a constructor
accepting a <i>Social</i> object as an argument.
<br>
Use the graphical components provided as attributes of the class.
<p>
The layout of the application must be similar to the one on the right.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Hint:<dd> you should consider nesting components by using <i>JPanel</i> as container, 
e.g. if you wish to have several components in the <i>NORTH</i> area of a border layout:
<i><pre>
setLayout(new BorderLayout());

JPanel upper = new JPanel();
upper.setLayout(new FlowLayout());
upper.add( ... );

add(upper,BorderLayout.NORTH);
</pre></i>
</dl>

<h2>R6 - Login</h2>
<img src="img/Error.png" style="float:right;width:25%;">
To login, a user must enter its unique code in the ID field and click the "Login" button.
<br>
When the user attempts to login, the system must check if the code is valid,
then it must show the first and last name of the user in the corresponding area
(indicated as "&lt; user name &gt;" in the mockup above).
<p>
If the code is invalid an error message box must be presented to the user:
<p>

After a positive login, the system must show the list of friends  in
the corresponding list component.

<dl>
<dt>Hint:<dd> use the <code>setListData(Object[])</code> method of class <code>JList</code> 
to populate the list content.</dl>
<p>
It must be also possible to login just hitting  <i>enter</i> after writing the code.
<p>
<dl>
<dt>Hint:<dd> use the <i>KeyListener</i> and in particular the <i>keyReleased()</i> method.
And compare the key code to the constant value <i>KeyEvent.VK_ENTER</i>.
</dl>
